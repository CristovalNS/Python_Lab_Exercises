# Python program for 180-degree rotation of point p around q.
# This program takes points (px, py) and (qx, qy) from the user
# and print point (rx, ry).

# Function
def find_point(x1: int, y1: int, x2: int, y2: int):
    print("The point r = (", 2 * x2 - x1, ",", 2 * y2 - y1, ")")
    return


# User input
x1 = int(input("Enter the value of x1: "))
y1 = int(input("Enter the value of y1: "))
x2 = int(input("Enter the value of x2: "))
y2 = int(input("Enter the value of y2: "))

# Output
find_point(x1, y1, x2, y2)
